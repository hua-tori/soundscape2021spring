The Sounds of Love

The following Soundscape project depicts an abstract story of the languages of love throughout ones life. The story opens with a distant memory, indistinguishable voices can be heard, while silverware and romantic music goes on. This scene ends with one audible phrase, "I love you". The next scene opens with light music in the background, almost whimsical, as birds and children can be heard running around inside. The sound of a school bus pulling up indicates the closing of the scene, as this scene ends with a similar phrase: "I love you! Be safe at school". The next scene changes tone, as more melancholic music is heard in the background, and a sense of being in a vehicle in the rain is felt as the audience is queued into a voicemail that is being left by a daughter to a mother. This scene too ends with, "Love you". Finally, the end scene opens with somber music, this time punctuated by sounds of crying and distress, and a voice on a microphone thanking everyone for coming. Mourning can be felt. This scene ends differently than the rest, with the final words not being love in the present tense, but love in the past and future tense. "Based on the sea of grieving faces here today, I know that she was loved... and the love she gave will carry on, even in her absence".

The theme of this whole piece is not just of love, but the changes and impact that such love has in a single life, and how it branches into the lives of others.
